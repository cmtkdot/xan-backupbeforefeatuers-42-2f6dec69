# Product Context: Financial Analytics System

## Why This Project Exists

The Financial Analytics System was created to address several critical challenges faced by businesses in managing and understanding their financial data:

1. **Data Fragmentation**: Financial data is often scattered across multiple systems and spreadsheets, making comprehensive analysis difficult and time-consuming.

2. **Reporting Complexity**: Creating consistent and accurate financial reports requires deep SQL knowledge and understanding of accounting principles.

3. **Limited Insights**: Basic financial systems provide statements without the analytical context needed for strategic decision-making.

4. **Accessibility Barriers**: Financial data is often locked in forms only finance professionals can interpret, limiting its usefulness to other stakeholders.
