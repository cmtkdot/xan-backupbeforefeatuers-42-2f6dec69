## Current Status

### Project Status: Early Development

The Financial Analytics System is currently in the early development phase, focusing on establishing the core database foundation and SQL query templates for financial reporting. The team has successfully designed the database schema and implemented key financial statement queries.

### Key Metrics

- **SQL Queries Completed**: 5 of 10 planned
- **Documentation Completion**: 90%
- **Database Schema Completion**: 95%
- **Frontend Development**: 0%
- **Overall Progress**: ~30%

### Upcoming Milestones

1. **Complete SQL Query Templates** (ETA: 2 weeks)
   - Finalize all planned financial analysis queries
   - Complete validation against accounting standards
   - Finish thorough documentation with examples

2. **Database Functions Implementation** (ETA: 3 weeks)
   - Convert all queries to parameterized PostgreSQL functions
   - Create test suite for validation
   - Optimize for performance

3. **API Layer Development** (ETA: 4 weeks)
   - Develop Edge Functions for report generation
   - Create frontend API client
   - Implement caching strategy

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

1. **Query Complexity**
   - Some financial queries are highly complex with multiple CTEs
   - Need refactoring for maintainability
   - Consider breaking into smaller modular functions

2. **Date Handling**
   - Currently using hardcoded dates in queries
   - Need to implement flexible date parameters
   - Should support fiscal year calculations

3. **Placeholder Schema**
   - Some table structures may need refinement
   - Indexing strategy not finalized
   - Potential normalization improvements needed

### Open Bugs

1. **Calculation Edge Cases**
   - Division by zero handling in some ratio calculations
   - Null handling in aggregation functions
   - Rounding inconsistencies in percentage calculations

2. **Schema Limitations**
   - Multi-currency support not fully implemented
   - Transaction categorization needs refinement
   - Budget-related tables need additional fields

### Performance Concerns

1. **Query Execution Time**
   - Complex queries may be slow with large datasets
   - Need for optimization and indexing
   - Potential for materialized views or caching

2. **Data Volume Handling**
   - Need to test with realistic data volumes
   - Pagination strategy for large reports
   - Response size management
