# Active Context: Financial Analytics System

## Current Work Focus

The team is currently focused on developing the core SQL queries for financial analysis and reporting. This phase involves creating robust, reusable SQL templates for generating key financial statements and analysis reports that will form the foundation of the system.

### Active Development Areas

1. **Financial Statement SQL Queries**
   - Balance Sheet query with assets, liabilities, and equity calculations
   - Cash Flow Statement query with operating, investing, and financing activities
   - Profit & Loss Statement (Income Statement) query with revenue and expense breakdowns
   - Financial Ratios Analysis query for key performance indicators

2. **Financial Analysis SQL Queries**
   - Profitability Analysis by customer, product, and time period
   - Budget Variance Analysis comparing actual vs. budgeted figures
   - Tax Liability Analysis tracking tax obligations and payments

3. **Documentation and Standards**
   - Comprehensive query documentation with usage examples
   - Database schema documentation for developers
   - Quick start guides for query customization

## Recent Changes

   - Added detailed comments and usage examples to all queries

3. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for SQL queries
   - Developed database schema guide
   - Created quick start guide for new developers

### In-Progress Work

1. **Additional Analysis Queries**
   - Accounts Receivable Aging query
   - Working Capital Analysis query
   - Cash Flow Forecast query

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Performance testing with large datasets

   - Finalize remaining analysis queries
   - Validate calculations against accounting standards
   - Add comprehensive error handling

2. **Develop Edge Functions**
   - Create Supabase Edge Functions for report generation
   - Implement parameter validation
   - Add response formatting for frontend consumption

3. **Database Functions**
   - Convert key queries to PostgreSQL functions
   - Add parameter validation
   - Create helper functions for common calculations

### Upcoming Major Features

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Create React hooks for data fetching
   - Develop report viewer components
   - Implement filter and parameter UI

2. **Visualization Components**
   - Develop chart components for financial data
   - Create dashboard widgets
   - Implement interactive data exploration

3. **User Management**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create user onboarding flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Query Structure Standardization**
   - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability
   - Following consistent naming conventions
   - Implementing error handling with COALESCE and NULLIF

2. **Date Handling Approach**
   - Using explicit date ranges for queries
   - Supporting parameterization for flexible reporting periods
   - Handling fiscal year calculations

3. **Performance vs. Flexibility Trade-offs**
   - Balancing query complexity with performance
   - Considering materialized views for frequent reports
   - Evaluating caching strategies for repeated queries

### Open Questions

1. **Schema Evolution**
   - How to handle schema migrations without breaking queries?
   - When to denormalize for reporting performance?
   - How to maintain backward compatibility?

2. **Multi-currency Support**
   - How to handle exchange rate calculations?
   - Should currency conversion be done in SQL or application layer?
   - How to display multi-currency reports?

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - How will query performance change with 5+ years of data?
   - What indexing strategy best supports analytical queries?
   - When should we consider partitioning tables?

### Current Blockers

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Need larger test dataset for realistic performance assessment
   - Identifying bottlenecks in complex queries
   - Determining appropriate indexes

2. **Edge Function Limitations**
   - Understanding timeout constraints for report generation
   - Managing response size limitations
   - Implementing pagination for large result sets

3. **Standard Compliance**
   - Validating calculations against accounting standards
   - Ensuring proper handling of edge cases
   - Documenting assumptions and limitations
